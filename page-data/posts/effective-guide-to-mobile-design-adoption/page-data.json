As a product becomes huge, this becomes a necessity and is also helpful in bringing brand changes easily. I have worked with Design Systems for some time now and one of the biggest issues is not with building it but rather how do you make everyone use it. If you are a large organization with multiple verticals, it becomes a gargantuan task aligning everyone. This guide represents some straightforward steps which you can take to ease this adoption.</p>\n<h2 id=\"start-with-design-team-\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#start-with-design-team-\" aria-label=\"start with design team  permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Start with Design Team üë´</h2>\n<p>A Design system must start with designers itself. If components are not present in the Design tool(Figma, Sketch etc), there is no point of creating them in code. If designers don‚Äôt have direct access to color tokens when they are creating design, you‚Äôre bound to fail.\nSecondly detaching components shouldn‚Äôt be allowed when using Design System components. For my code writing fellows, detaching components is equivalent to copy pasting a class instead of using an existing one because you want to change one function inside it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"make-discovery-obvious-\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#make-discovery-obvious-\" aria-label=\"make discovery obvious  permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Make discovery obvious üîé</h2>\n<p>Once a Design System is built, it must be dead simple for everyone(devs, designers, PM) to visualize it.

Figma links should be previewed inside the doc.</li>\n<li>Code documentations should be written by developers with exhaustive API usages. Use tools like <code class=\"language-text\">dokka</code> to produce HTML pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These docs should be combined at a single place -  a website, notion/confluence doc, which then becomes a single source of documentation for your Design System.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-showcase-apps\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-showcase-apps\" aria-label=\" showcase apps permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>‚û° Showcase Apps</h4>\n<p>A centralized doc will allow anyone to look is a good start, but docs don‚Äôt provide look and feel of components. Everyone should be able to feel the shiny button animation which took 3 days to build, no?</p>\n<p>Showcase Apps are simple apps which display rendered components with all their variations for everyone to see. Developers will often be more comfortable by checking out components in per platform apps. These apps can easily be distributed with Firebase Distribution or any other app distribution system you use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"making-code-adoption-easy-\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#making-code-adoption-easy-\" aria-label=\"making code adoption easy  permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Making code adoption easy üë®‚Äçüíª</h2>\n<p>If you think making a kick ass Design System with awesome discovery will cause everyone to adopt it, think again lol.

That‚Äôs why as UI platform engineer, it‚Äôs your job to make this easier for fellow engineers.</p>\n<p>The answer is Lint.</p>\n<p>No not Android Lint, well at least not in principle. Linting is a process where you can provide immediate feedback to developers while writing code.\nIf a developer writes <code class=\"language-text\">TextView</code> which has a mapped component in the Design System, you show a tiny warning that please use <code class=\"language-text\">DSTextView</code> and so on. Such warnings can go on for color tokens and any number of framework or custom components.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Android‚Äôs Lint system</a> allows you to write such custom rules quite easily for any language(XML, Kotlin, Java) but has performance issues with large projects. You can roll out your own Lint by using IntelliJ‚Äôs API around PSI. Furthermore you can use Lint checks as blocker on pull requests using tools like <a href=\"https://danger.systems/ruby/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Danger</a>.</p>\n<p>Fun Fact: Android‚Äôs Lint allows you to write quick fixes as well, so you can rewrite entire component code according to Design System specifications with one click. This can be invoked via command line as well which can help with automated migration.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-api-design\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-api-design\" aria-label=\" api design permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>‚û° API design</h4>\n<p>API of components must be future proof - your system will evolve, if brittle changes break APIs you are discouraging others to use it. Components should be built with composition in mind, where every layer could be broken down into blocks.</p>\n<p>For your own sanity, keep everything private and only expose outer layers. Remember it‚Äôs always easier to make private code public later if reusability use-case occurs but making a public code private will send you down a migration spiral from which you may never recover.</p>\n<p>Lower level components like Text, Button etc should try to mimic framework component APIs to help with muscle memory of engineers. But sometimes framework components itself have batshit APIs, so in such cases use your better senses for API design.</p>\n<h2 id=\"build-metrics-\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#build-metrics-\" aria-label=\"build metrics  permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Build Metrics üìä</h2>\n<p>Once you have done everything to help with discovery and code adoption, it is time for visualization.

You need the results of Lint static analysis here. You can use the Lint system to list down who‚Äôs using what, are they using <code class=\"language-text\">TextView</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">DSTextView</code>, are they using hardcoded colors or color tokens etc. From this build a website, which shows % of adoption of Design System in each project/module/product and showcase it to everyone.\nIf you have rapport with product teams, you can even set OKRs using this number (ex. 80% design system coverage in Q2).</p>\n<p>PS: If you are currently stuck at Design System adoption, do this step at priority and see your numbers fly by next quarter.</p>\n<h4 id=\"-the-who-uses-metric\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-the-who-uses-metric\" aria-label=\" the who uses metric permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>‚û° The who uses metric</h4>\n<p>This is a show off metric to feel good about yourself. It is the reverse of what we did earlier, using the same data from Lint static analysis, we figure out how many times a project/module/product used our component. This gives a count of component usages, multiplied by a calculated number of hours (effort a product dev would take to build this component himself) and you get the number of hours the team saved because they used the Design System component.

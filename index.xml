      <description>I currently work as an Android Engineer at GO-JEK in a design focussed team to keep UI ASAP(As Shiny As Possible). Previously I worked at Amadeus Labs, building mobile applications for airlines all over the world.
I ocassionally write blogs and do some open source stuff on Github. I also talk a bit about Android and Kotlin at user groups and conferences and can always be found hanging around at BlrDroid and BlrKotlin meetup groups.</description>
